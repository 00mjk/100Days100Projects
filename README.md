## Purpose

100 Days - 100 Projects it's a challenge that's meant to help you improve your coding skills by creating projects (lots of them :smiley:).

You can find the detailed information about the Challenge [on my blog](https://florin-pop.com/blog/2019/09/100-days-100-projects).

In this repository you'll be able to propose new projects by creating an issue for each of them.

Have fun! :innocent:
