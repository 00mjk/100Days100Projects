## Purpose

100 Days - 100 Projects it's a challenge I'm going to take that it's meant to improve my programming skills by build projects (lots of them :smiley:).

## Rules

- create a project per day
- a project could be: **an app**, **a component**, **a website**, **a game**, **a library**, etc
- the project has to be done by 11:59 PM my time (GMT+3)
- in this repository you'll be able to find a link to all of the projects that I'm going to create
- if I fail to complete the project for the day, the first 5 people to point it out on Twitter ([@florinpop1705](https://twitter.com/florinpop1705)) will receive $5 via PayPal (a total of $25) - Make sure you check the time in my timezone first :wink:
